# about-me
Hi, I’m Krishna 👋

I work on data analytics and financial intelligence, focused on building
practical systems that help businesses make better decisions.

My work includes:
- Financial and business data analysis
- Dashboards and reporting systems
- Forecasting and risk models
- Data pipelines and analytics workflows
- Applied analytics for operational decision-making

I’m currently building structured projects in finance, banking, and operations,
with a long-term interest in scalable, data-driven systems.

Learning by building. Researching by doing.
