# about-me
Hi, I’m Krishna 👋
I’m currently focused on learning Data Analytics and Business Intelligence with a strong interest in how data supports business decision-making, operations, and strategy.

I enjoy working on hands-on projects, analyzing real-world datasets, and understanding how organizations use data to improve efficiency and performance.

Alongside analytics, I’m building a solid foundation in quantitative thinking, systems understanding, and problem-solving, with a long-term interest in working across complex industries.

I’m open to learning opportunities, collaborations, and practical projects where data meets real business problems.
